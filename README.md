# 7ev3nDev's dotfiles

This is my current and first rice for hyprland!

Thanks to [Ollie](https://github.com/PilkDrinker) for making this possible by forking his dotfiles and modifying them to adapt them for my laptop (T14 Gen 1).

# Installation for Arch
To run the installation script for Arch or and arch-based distro like Manjaro, copy and paste these commands in your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/7ev3nDev/hyprland-dots/
cd hyprland-dots
sudo chmod +x ./install-arch.sh
./install-arch.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> This installation script is currently limited to Arch and derivatives, and is not 100% done. Some features may need to be configured manually.


## Extra configuration
Rember to change your GTK theme and icons using GTK-look/nwg-look or the terminal

You can also changed your desired Wallpaper directory in .config/waypaper/config.ini

For the Theme to work in certain GTK apps, you might need to add the theme's assets diretory to ~/.config/assets
