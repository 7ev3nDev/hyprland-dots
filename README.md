# Pilk's dotfiles

These are my current dotfiles.
A very clean look for hyprland. As well as my first ever rice ðŸ¤“

Most of these original config files were made by other [people](https://github.com/PilkDrinker/PilkDots?tab=readme-ov-file#original-work) in the community and then alterted by me.
A lot of the heavy work was made by [Stephan Raabe](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork) (ML4W) who made the inital dotfiles I edited.

Also a big thanks to [Ksawlii](https://github.com/Ksawlii) for making the installation script! ðŸ’™

Huge thanks to [Ksawlii](https://github.com/Ksawlii) for making this installtion script! <3

> [!NOTE]
> This installation script is currently limited to Gentoo, and is not 100% done. Some features may need to be configured manually.

# Manual Installation
```
1. Install the dependencies with your preffered AUR helper.
2. Clone the repository
3. Move the .config, .themes, and wallpaper into your home directory
4. Install the listed fonts
5. Set up zsh (Optional)
6. Change your GTK theme and icons (Using GTK-look/nwg-look or the terminal)
```

## Extra configuration
There is a few optional configurations and alts in the .config directory (waybar borders etc.) Feel free to alter whatever you want to make it your own style. ðŸ¥°

You can also changed your desired Wallpaper diretory in .config/waypaper/config.ini

For the Theme to work in certain GTK apps, you might need to add the theme's assets diretory to ~/.config/assets
